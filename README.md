# lasercube

A Rust implementation of the LaserCube network protocol for controlling
LaserCube devices.

## Overview

This workspace provides a set of crates for communicating with LaserCube
devices over the network. LaserCube is a portable laser projector created by
LaserOS (https://www.laseros.com). This library allows you to control LaserCube
devices programmatically using Rust.

## Crates

- **lasercube-core**: Core types, constants, encodings and decodings for the
  LaserCube protocol.
- **lasercube**: Main library providing high-level interfaces for discovering
  and controlling LaserCube devices.

## Usage

See the `examples/` directory for a demonstration.

## Protocol Documentation

The LaserCube protocol was derived by reading [this python
implementation][python-impl].

See [SPECIFICATION.md](./SPECIFICATION.md).
